                    <p>
                        I have more than 9 years of experience as a backend engineer working with a variety of technology stacks and domains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Math, logic, and problem-solving are my three main areas of interest. I see software engineering as the use of such analytical abilities combined with some creativity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the weekends, you could find me attempting to comprehend how various systems operate from the inside out.
                        This motivates me to develop thoughtful solutions at work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want to adopt a more sophisticated and comprehensive perspective on computer science.
                        I'm currently moving on to the next stage of my work, where I'm delving more deeply into the technology that we use every day.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        I aim to develop a more holistic and finer outlook on computer science. 
                        <br>
                        I'm currently transitioning towards the next part of my work, where I'll be delving further into the technologies that we utilize on a daily basis.
                        Like Databases, OS, Advanced Algorithms & DS, etc
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm eager to work with others on initiatives that fit my interests and skill set.
                        <br>
                        I hope you find my portfolio informative and enjoyable. &#128513;
