                    <p>
                        I have close to 10 years of experience as a backend engineer working with a variety of technology stacks and domains.
                        To me Software Engineering is application of Math, logic, and creative problem-solving. Being curious is my strength I would say.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I often spend time in weekends trying to understand how systems work under the hood. This involves some experimenting and reverse engineering. 
                        This helps me to develop a more holistic, finer outlook on computer science and eventually to develop better solutions at work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want to adopt a more sophisticated and comprehensive perspective on computer science.
                        Recently, I started to delve more deeply into some popular technologies that people take for granted.
                        Like - Databases, distributed systems, concurrency, computer graphics, machine learning, Advanced Algorithms & DS. much more...
                        I can never claim that I have learnt enough, or that I am the best expert in the town and I guess that is ok... as long as the learning never stops. 
                        It's the progress that matters in the end, doesn't matter where the starting point is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll soon be writing some blog posts on topics that I found really interesting. Hope the readers find them interesting as well.
                    </p>
