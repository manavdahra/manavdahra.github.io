                    <p>
                        I'm a Backend Engineer having 9+ YOE in multiple domains and technology stacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interest lies in problem solving, math and logical reasoning. <br>
                        To me software engineering is an application of those analytical skills sprinkled with creativity. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On weekends, I satisfy my curiosities by understanding how different systems work under the hood. 
                        This inspires me to come up with well engineered solutions at my work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I aiming to develop a more holistic and finer outlook on computer science. 
                        <br>
                        Currently I'm transitioning into the next phase of my career where I am diving deeper into technologies which we use on a day-to-day basis. 
                        Like Databases, OS, Advanced Algorithms & DS, etc
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I looking forward to collaborate on anything that matches my skillset and brings opportunity for growth and learning.
                        <br>
