            Hi, This is Manav Dahra. I'm interested in problem solving, math and logical reasoning. 
            To me software engineering is an application of those analytical skills sprinkled with creativity. 
            During the times when I am more curious, I like to spend my time peeking on how things work under the hood and possibly borrow some ingenious ideas (possibly apply them where ever possible). 
            I'm always interested in anything that is novel and challenging.
        </p>

            Currently I'm transitioning into the next phase of my career where I am diving deeper into how databases and distributed systems work. 
            I'm also brushing up my DS and Algo skills but with more wisdom now. 
            I'm aiming to develop a more holistic and finer outlook on computer science.
        </p>

            I'm looking forward to collaborate on anything that matches my skillset and brings opportunity for growth and learning.
